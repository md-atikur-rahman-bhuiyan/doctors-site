                    As an oral and facial surgeon, Dr. Miller discovered limitations in treating patients through the narrow traditional lens.  He created a space where he could Test, Optimize and Prevent disease—in style.  His T.O.P. Health model empowers patients to be more of their own best doctor.  With the guidance of a rare, single-source, oral surgeon and integrative medicine expert, Dr. Miller provides medicine “above the fray” and gives patients better control over their health.  We pride ourselves on bridging the gaps between surgeons, dentists, traditional medicine practitioners and the growing holistic medicine community – so you can get the answers you deserve.

                    It takes a focused, skillful team dedicated to safety, excellence and experience to raise the hot air balloons in Cappadocia, Turkey. We take the same approach to keeping our patients soaring. Our passionate team and network partners each bring unique skills to our treatment plans with the shared goal of seeing our patients live out their bucket lists (like drifting over Love Valley in Cappadocia for a sunset balloon ride.)

                    If you’re used to working with doctors at “big box” hospitals, a private practice integrative doctor may be confusing and raise some questions. We understand, we’re different on purpose, but that’s why we can help. We’re happy to answer questions, and with your trust…get to the root of your health concern.
