                       <p>I just want to say THANK YOU to Dr Miller and Hannah for getting me through Covid. It took one message that I tested positive to Dr Miller and suddenly my immune system was in his hands. Being a high risk patient, I truly believed I would end up in ICU on a ventilator.  Instead, three weeks later I am Covid-free spending time with my dogs on the beach! I am thoroughly blessed to be his patient!</p>

                        I just want to give a huge shout out and thank you to Dr. Adam Miller. After the first visit with Dr. Miller, I knew I finally found a doctor that truly was listening to me and honestly cared about my overall health. It has been 3 months now and I feel and act like my younger self again. I tell everyone I can (especially my friends entering or in the midst of menopause) about what a difference Dr. Miller has made in my life.
