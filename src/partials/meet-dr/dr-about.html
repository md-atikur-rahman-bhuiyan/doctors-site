                        I love adventure and playing in the jungle or mountains are great reasons for me to maintain peak health. But skiing, mountain biking and trekking at forty isn’t the same as it was in my twenties. To look and feel my best, my body requires more attention, more respect.

                        After globe trotting as a surgeon for six years I got “altitude sickness.”  I hit the proverbial wall in SE Asia.  From 2011-2013 I suffered from adrenal fatigue, dental breakdown, pericarditis, irritable bowel and intestinal parasites. That period was the big scare that got me, a successful surgeon, thinking differently about my health and the shortcomings of the US healthcare system.  Nothing makes a doctor more passionate about helping others than experiencing life as a helpless patient.  My passion for holistic and integrative care comes first from my victory as a patient.

                        Maybe your altitude sickness is from flying high as a super-mom or being a hero-boss at work.  There are many good reasons to push your body.  But, far too many of us are paying the price for living hard and neglecting our health.  I’ve dedicated my career to helping people recover from or prevent the stress-related diseases that wrecked my body.  As you walk the path of restoration, you will see my footprints on the trail beneath you. (Click on “Dr.Miller’s History” below for more about my medical history.)
