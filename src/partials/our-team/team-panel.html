                                Dr. Miller is a dentist, surgeon, and integrative medicine expert who has trekked the globe looking for the heart of the matter.  He founded ARISE MD to help bridge the gap between dental and medical practices, evolve treatment and medicine to allow patients to become their own best doctor with efficiency, physician-patient education, and their self efficacy.  In his free time he enjoys exploring the outdoors, mountain biking, skiing, and appreciating art and music of all forms with his wife, Brittney.  His faith is just one of the aspects that make him a unique doctor and man.  He has a deep passion for helping others that goes beyond the four walls of the ARISE MD practice and celebrates meeting and talking to people from all walks of life.
